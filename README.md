# 2018-6-04  the Bedroom
My bed is nice and soft.<br/>
I have a pretty bedspread on my bed.<br/>
I have sheets and a blanket on my bed also.<br/>
I use two feather pillows.<br/>
My pillows have pillowcases on them.<br/>
My dresser has a mirror on it.<br/>
I have a lamp on top of my dresser.<br/>
I also have some picture frames with pictures of my friends and family on top of my dresser.<br/>
There is an alarm clock beside my bed so that I can wake up on time in the morning.<br/>
I keep many clothes in my dresser drawers.<br/>
The drawers are nice and deep.<br/>
My closet is large.<br/>
It is a walk-in closet.<br/>
I have my clothes hanging in my closet.<br/>
I keep games up there.<br/>
There is a rup on my bedroom floor.<br/>
My bedroom window looks out over my back yard.<br/>
There are curtains on my bedroom window.<br/>
My bedroom is very cozy.<br/>
At night,I turn off the lamp and get under covers.<br/>
I set my alarm clock at seven O'clock.<br/>
I lay my head on the pillow,and I fall asleep.<br/>
